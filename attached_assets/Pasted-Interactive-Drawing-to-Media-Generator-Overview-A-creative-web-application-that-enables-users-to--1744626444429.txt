2.	Transform their drawings into AI-generated cartoon images
3.	Extract emotional context from the generated images
4.	Generate music that matches the emotional tone
5.	Experience a complete multi-modal creative output from a simple drawing input

o	Context modifiers (e.g., "as if it were in a dream sequence")
o	Character modifiers (e.g., "reimagined as a superhero")
o	Material modifiers (e.g., "if it were made of cheese")
o	Artist style modifiers (e.g., "in the style of [famous cartoon artist]")
•	Selection Algorithm: Weighted randomization that selects 1-2 modifiers while ensuring the result maintains recognizable similarity to the original drawing
3. Emotional Analysis and Music Generation

Implementation Flow
1. User Interaction Flow
User Drawing → Image Generation → Emotional Analysis → Music Generation → Final Presentation
2. API Integration Sequence
1. Canvas Data → Image Generation API
2. Generated Image → Image Analysis/Description API
3. Emotional Text → Music Generation API
4. Final Output → User Display
3. Detailed Process Steps
1.	User creates drawing on the canvas
2.	User clicks "Generate" button
3.	Application: 
o	Captures canvas content as image
o	Selects random prompt modifiers
o	Shows loading indicator
4.	API Request #1: 
o	Send image + prompts to image generation API
o	Receive cartoon-style image
5.	Display generated image in output area
6.	API Request #2: 
o	Send image to description/analysis service
o	Request emotional/mood focus in analysis
o	Receive text description
7.	Display emotional description
8.	API Request #3: 
o	Send emotional description to music generation API
o	Receive generated music file
9.	Load music into audio player
10.	Enable download options for both image and music
Technical Requirements
